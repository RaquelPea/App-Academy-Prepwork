Hello, Raqui here!

Check out my experiments in Ruby. I am learning by the test-first approach,
where I immediately apply the syntax I've learned
to solve increasingly difficult challenge problems.

I hope to apply programming to my creative field of architecture and interaction design,
so tag along and watch my evolution of coding.

Thanks for stopping by,

- R
